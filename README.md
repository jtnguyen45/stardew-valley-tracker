# Stardew Valley Tracker
*Stardew Valley Tracker* is a web app that aims to make tracking your in-game progress in the game Stardew valley easier. The tracker will help users see what items they are missing and which collection bundle is incomplete. Information about finishing the Community Center and the items needed to complete them will be in one convenient place and will allow users to keep track of their progress across different save files as well.

I plan to design and implement a MongoDB database to store the game item catalogs, user collection progress, and user data. I will employ CRUD operations to enable seamless management of game data, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.
