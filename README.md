# Stardew Valley Tracker
*Stardew Valley Tracker* is a web app that aims to make tracking your in-game progress in the game Stardew valley easier. The tracker will help users see what items they are missing and which collection bundle is incomplete. Information about finishing the Community Center and the items needed to complete them will be in one convenient place and will allow users to keep track of their progress across different save files as well.

Each item entry will tell you which season the item can be grown/found in, locations you can find them, and the in-game description for them. Users will also be able to create, view, update, and delete items and bundles for full customization of their gameplay experience.

## Getting Started
To start tracking your progress or if you want to look up general information on the in-game items and bundles, you can do so [here](https://stardew-valley-tracker-app-776739768320.herokuapp.com/).

Here is where you will be able to see all of the bundles available in the database:

## Next Steps
- *Image Customization:* Allow users to upload their own images for items or bundles they create.
- *Tracker Sharing:* Give users the ability to share their trackers and add other users as collaborators, since Stardew Valley supports multiplayer and you would share the farm with others.
- *User Privacy:* Add option to users to have the items, bundles, or trackers they created to be private.
